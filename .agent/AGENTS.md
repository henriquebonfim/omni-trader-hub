# Agent Pipeline

Automated engineering pipeline. Issues in, shipped releases out.

---

## Quick Start

```
/start-workflow
```

---

## Pipeline

```
Issues → Triage → Score → Branch → Implement → PR → Review → Merge → Release → O11y
```

| Stage | Command |
|-------|---------|
| Context scan | `/start-workflow` |
| Issue triage | `/handle-issues` |
| Implementation | `/handle-code <task>` |
| PR review | `/handle-pr-review <N>` |
| PR fixes | `/handle-pr-code <N>` |
| Merge | `/handle-close-pr <N>` |
| Release | `/handle-release` |

## Key Mandates

1. **Strict Makefile Commands**: All test/lint/build/typecheck commands go through `make` targets defined in `stack.make`. Never guess package managers.
2. **Sequential-Thinking MCP**: Mandatory for all multi-step tasks. Think → Plan → Act → Verify.
3. **Docker-First Execution**: All tests and builds run inside containers when available.
4. **Jules Discipline**: Always `jules remote pull --apply`. Always branch first. Always verify in Docker.
5. **Friction Logging**: Every technical hurdle recorded in `.agent/logs/FRICTION.md`.

---

## Jules Discipline

1. **Branch First**: `git checkout -b feature/...` before pulling
2. **Poll for Completion**: `make j-poll ID=<id>` (async wait for remote session)
3. **Pull with Apply**: `make j-pull ID=<id>` (uses `--apply`)
4. **Docker Verify**: `make test && make lint` after pull
5. **Self-Correct**: If Jules breaks patterns, fix before committing

---

## Setup

1. Copy `.agent/` into project root
2. Edit `.agent/make/stack.make` with your project's exact commands
3. Add lines from `_gitignore-additions.txt` to `.gitignore`
4. Ensure `gh auth status` passes
5. Run `/start-workflow`

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"ABORT: protected branch"** → `git checkout -b feature/<name>`
- **Wrong test command** → Edit `.agent/make/stack.make`
- **Jules not completing** → `make j-poll ID=<id>` or `make j-list`
